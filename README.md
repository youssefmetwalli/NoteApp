# NoteApp

A simple note web app created using react, bootstrap css and typescript.

For this web app, I decided to try something different and not use a database for this project. Saving user data in the local storage of each browser instead. 

## User Manual:

The user will be first greeted with a blank list of notes, search bars for note titles and tags, and buttons to create and edit tags.

To create a new note, the user can simply click on the create button, enter note details, then click on save.

To delete or modify an existing note, the user simply has to click on the note on the notes' list, and subsequently click on either the delete or edit buttons.

Upon creating a new note, the user is required to add a title and some tags related to the note, both of which the user can later use to search for that specific note
